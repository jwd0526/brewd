## 1. Overview
Brewd is a mobile application for coffee lovers to share their creations, learn from others, and improve their coffee making abilities

**Example:**
> This document describes the architecture of the FitTrack mobile app, which enables users to monitor their workouts, track nutrition, and sync data with wearable devices.

### 1.1 Objectives
- Define the app’s key goals and use cases.
- Outline architectural drivers (e.g., offline-first, cross-platform, performance).
- Clarify success criteria (latency, reliability, usability).

### 1.2 Scope
Describe what’s included in this document (e.g., mobile client architecture, data flow, integrations) and what’s out of scope (e.g., backend microservices, marketing website).

## 2. System Context

### 2.1 Context Diagram
*(Include or link to a diagram showing the app, backend services, third-party APIs, and external systems.)*

### 2.2 External Dependencies
| System / API | Description | Protocol / SDK |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Backend API | Core data & authentication | REST / GraphQL |
| Firebase | Push notifications & analytics | Firebase SDK |
| Stripe | Payment processing | HTTPS / SDK |
| Apple Health / Google Fit | Health data integration | Platform APIs |

---

## 3. Mobile Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Platform & Framework
| Platform | Technology | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| iOS | SwiftUI + Combine | Native |
| Android | Kotlin + Jetpack Compose | Native |
| Cross-Platform (if applicable) | React Native / Flutter | — |

### 3.2 Architectural Pattern
Describe the architectural pattern(s) used and the rationale.

**Examples:**
- MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)
- Clean Architecture
- Redux / MVI (for state management)

### 3.3 High-Level Component Diagram
*(Add a diagram showing layers such as UI, domain, data, network, and persistence.)*

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 UI Layer
- Structure of screens, navigation (e.g., navigation graph, coordinator pattern).
- UI framework details (SwiftUI, Compose, Flutter widgets, etc.).
- Theming and design system overview.

### 4.2 Domain Layer
- Business logic and use cases.
- ViewModels or controllers that handle user interactions.

### 4.3 Data Layer
- Data sources: local DB, remote APIs, cache.
- Repository pattern or data flow.
- Example data pipeline diagram (Local Cache ↔ Repository ↔ Network).

### 4.4 Network Layer
- Networking library (e.g., Retrofit, Alamofire, Apollo).
- API versioning and error handling.
- Request/response models.

### 4.5 Local Storage
- Database or caching solution (e.g., Room, Core Data, Realm, SQLite).
- Data synchronization and conflict resolution.

---

## 5. Backend Integration

### 5.1 API Contracts
Describe how the app communicates with backend services.
- REST or GraphQL endpoints.
- Authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
- Example API call structure.

### 5.2 Sync Strategy
- Real-time updates (WebSockets, Firebase, etc.).
- Offline-first and retry logic.
- Data consistency guarantees.

---

## 6. Security and Privacy
- Data encryption (in transit & at rest).
- Secure storage (Keychain, EncryptedSharedPrefs).
- Authentication & session management.
- Handling PII (personal data) and compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

---

## 7. Performance and Optimization
- App startup time targets.
- Memory & battery usage guidelines.
- Network request optimization (batching, caching, pagination).

---

## 8. Testing Strategy
| Test Type | Framework / Tool | Description |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Unit Tests | JUnit / XCTest | Logic validation |
| UI Tests | Espresso / XCUITest | End-to-end UI verification |
| Integration Tests | MockWebServer / Firebase Test Lab | Network + data flow |
| Beta Testing | TestFlight / Firebase App Distribution | Pre-release testing |

---

## 9. Build, Deployment, and CI/CD
- Build tools and scripts (Gradle, Xcode build, Fastlane).
- CI/CD pipeline overview (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, Codemagic, etc.).
- Release channels (alpha, beta, production).
- Versioning and release notes process.

---

## 10. Analytics and Monitoring
- Analytics tools (Firebase Analytics, Amplitude, Segment).
- Crash reporting (Crashlytics, Sentry).
- Metrics dashboards.

---

## 11. Dependencies
List key libraries and their purpose.

| Category | Library | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Networking | Retrofit / Alamofire | HTTP client |
| Dependency Injection | Hilt / Koin / Dagger | Manage app dependencies |
| Image Loading | Coil / Glide | Efficient image handling |
| Reactive Programming | Coroutines / Combine / RxSwift | Async data flow |

---

## 12. Risks and Technical Debt
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Large bundle size | Medium | Optimize assets, use code shrinking |
| Offline sync conflicts | High | Implement merge rules in repository layer |

---

## 13. Future Enhancements
- Planned features or refactors.
- Planned architecture evolution (e.g., modularization, multi-module setup).
